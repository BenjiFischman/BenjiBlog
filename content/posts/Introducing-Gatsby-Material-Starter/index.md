This is the first of many posts to my new blog! You may be asking yourself,
 *<center>"Who is Benji, and why do I care?"</center>*

Great question!

My interests and hobbies are pretty diverse. For example, I am PADI certified Master Scuba diver, I like to spin fire poi, and I have an Instagram account that I use as a photo journal to catalog bathrooms of the world [@bathroomsoftheworld](http://instagram.com/bathroomsoftheworld). I like to think of myself as a creative goofball that enjoys building things and helping people.


You might be wondering,

*<center>"What the hell is a fire poi?"</center>*


**Here is a picture of me spinning fire poi**

Proffesionally and academically, my interests are at the intersection of Human Computer Interactions, Language, and Design. I will begin a full-time position with Microsoft as a Program Manger this summer, so the NDA will likley restrict the content I am able to share. But that won't stop me from chronicalling my experience as a fresh college graduate entering the west coast tech industry.

Follow my journey to discover what I want to be when I grow up.



Cheers,

-Benji Fischman
