# Capstone User Interface Design Class Project

One of my first experiences with user interface and design was lead by Dr. Lana Yarosh at the University of Minnesota.

The goal of the class was to design a mobile app that adresses the needs and frustrations of the student body. Qualatative research suggested students were frustrated that they could not find viable and novel study locations on campus.

The team I worked on prototyped an andriod app we called UDiscover.

UDiscover is a spatio-temporal recommendation system, which aims to address the core academic frustrations at the University of Minnesota-Twins Cities campus.
