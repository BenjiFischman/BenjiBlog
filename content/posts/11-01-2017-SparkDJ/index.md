# Collabrative Music Recomendation for Parties


[Spark DJ](https://spark.dj/) is a music streaming service that combines DJ inspiration, seamless song transitions and requests from the crowd. The app allows a user to host a party anytime, anywhere, and can range from a quick hour with friends to formal occasions where background music is a must-have. I was the project manager for a student group, [DesignU](https://www.designu-mn.org/), that was tasked with the design, user experience evaluation, and potentially implementation of a novel feature to replace Spark Dj's party chat.

Focus groups and user interviews are two great methods to aggregate qualitative data. We collected qualatative data from 15 University of Minnesota students. Analysis suggests that people enjoy parties if the music adapts to the crowdsâ€™ preference, the Dj facilitates real-world social interaction, and the overall ambiance is in harmony with the environment. Low fidelity prototypes have validated these findings, which helped inspire the high fidelity prototype and gamification of user interactions.Spark Dj has already implemented some of my suggestions into their app, and initial user evaluation has been very positive- download the Spark Dj app in IOS store!
